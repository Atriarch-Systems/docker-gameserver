name: Sync Upstream to Main
# This workflow keeps the 'main' branch as an exact mirror of upstream.
# We use force-push (git reset --hard) instead of merge because:
# 1. The 'main' branch should be a pure mirror with no local changes
# 2. Force-push avoids merge commits that would pollute the history
# 3. All customizations live on 'atriarch' branch, not 'main'
# 4. This makes it easy to see exactly what upstream has changed
#
# Flow: upstream → main (this workflow) → atriarch (merge-to-atriarch.yml)
